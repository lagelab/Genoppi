<b>SNP-to-gene mapping</b> <br><i>description</i>: A dataset containing 19,326 protein-coding genes (GENCODE v43) mapped to SNP IDs (dbSNP build 156). A gene is linked to a SNP if its genomic coordinates overlap with linkage disequilibrium (LD) locus boundaries of the SNP. LD loci were calculated using the 1000 Genomes phase 3 EUR panel and PLINK, defined as regions spanning tagging SNPs (r2 > 0.6) Â± 50kb; SNPs with MAF < 0.05 were excluded. <br><i>source</i>: GENCODE v43 data downloaded from: https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_43/gencode.v43.basic.annotation.gtf.gz <br><i>references</i>: # Frankish A, Diekhans M, Jungreis I, et al.
