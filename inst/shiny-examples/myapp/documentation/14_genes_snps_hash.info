<b>HuRI data (HI-union network)</b> <br><i>description</i>: TO ADD A dataset containing 19,326 protein-coding genes (GENCODE v43) mapped to SNP IDs (dbSNP build 156). A gene is linked to a SNP if its genomic coordinates overlap with linkage disequilibrium (LD) locus boundaries of the SNP. LD loci were calculated using the 1000 Genomes phase 3 EUR panel and PLINK, defined as regions spanning tagging SNPs (r2 > 0.6) ± 50kb; SNPs with MAF < 0.05 were excluded. <br><i>source</i>: HuRI data (HI-union network) data downloaded on 2023-10-10 from: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2188-x <br><i>references</i>: Luck, K., Kim, DK., Lambourne, L. et al.
