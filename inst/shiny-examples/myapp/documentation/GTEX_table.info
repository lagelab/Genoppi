<b>GTEx tissue specificity annotations</b> <br><i>description</i>: A dataset containing tissue specificty annotations for 20,025 genes in 53 tissues derived from GTEx RNA-sequencing data. See cited reference for details on the definition of tissue-specific genes. In brief, genes that rank in the top 10 percent of a tissue-based t-statistic distribution are defined as the specific genes for the tissue. <br><i>source</i>: GTEx.tstat.tsv dataset (2018-06-25 release) downloaded on 2020-06-15 from: https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/LDSC_SEG_ldscores/tstats/):. <br><i>references</i>: Finucane HK, Reshef YA, Anttila V, et al.
